# jergadic-starter-pro: Security Guidelines

This document provides **security best practices** and **actionable recommendations** tailored to the jergadic-starter-pro repository. It aligns with core security principles—Security by Design, Least Privilege, Defense in Depth, Input Validation, and Fail Securely—to ensure a robust foundation for development, deployment, and maintenance.

---

## 1. Security by Design & Project Overview

- **Embed Security Early**: Treat every new feature (UI, routing, API, authentication) with security in mind from the design phase.
- **Repository Structure**:  
  • `app/` – UI components, global styles, fonts, routing  
  • `app/api/` – Webhook endpoint  
  • `components/` – Reusable UI and provider wrappers  
  • `.cursor/rules/` – Project standards and documentation  

Use this structure to map security controls to each layer.

---

## 2. Authentication & Access Control

### 2.1 Clerk Integration
- **Secure Configuration**  
  • Store Clerk API keys and secrets in environment variables.
  • Use a secrets management solution (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager).
- **Session Management**  
  • Ensure `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Strict` cookie flags.  
  • Enforce idle and absolute timeouts for sessions.  
  • Implement logout endpoint that revokes sessions server-side.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  • Define user roles (e.g., `admin`, `user`).  
  • Enforce server-side permission checks for all protected routes.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
  • Enable MFA for administrative or sensitive operations.

---

## 3. Input Validation & Webhook Security

### 3.1 Webhook Handler (`app/api/webhooks/route.ts`)
- **Signature Verification**  
  • Validate incoming webhooks against a known secret (HMAC or public key).  
  • Reject any request failing signature checks (HTTP 401).
- **Schema Validation**  
  • Use a schema validation library (e.g., Zod, Joi) to enforce payload structure.  
  • Reject invalid or unexpected fields (HTTP 400).
- **Rate Limiting & Throttling**  
  • Employ an in-memory or distributed rate limiter (e.g., Redis-based) to prevent abuse.

### 3.2 URL & Redirect Sanitization
- **Allow-List Redirects**  
  • Validate any dynamic redirect targets against a trusted list to prevent open redirect.

---

## 4. Data Protection & Privacy

- **Encrypt In Transit**  
  • Enforce HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ on all requests.  
  • Redirect HTTP to HTTPS at the server or CDN layer.
- **Encrypt At Rest**  
  • Use database-level encryption for PII and sensitive fields.
  • Leverage cloud-provider encryption (e.g., AWS RDS encryption).
- **Secrets Management**  
  • Do not commit API keys, DB credentials, or webhook secrets to source control.  
  • Rotate secrets periodically and on any suspected compromise.
- **Logging & Masking**  
  • Log webhook events and errors, omitting or masking PII.  
  • Scrub sensitive data from logs.

---

## 5. API & Service Security

- **HTTPS Enforcement**  
  • Serve both frontend and API over TLS.  
  • HSTS header: `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`
- **CORS Policy**  
  • Restrict to allowed origins (e.g., your frontend domain).  
  • Do not use wildcard (`*`) in production.
- **HTTP Methods**  
  • Use POST for state-changing actions (e.g., webhooks).  
  • Validate method at the route level and return HTTP 405 for unsupported verbs.

---

## 6. Web Application Security Hygiene

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**  
  • Define a strict CSP header to block XSS and mixed content:
    ```
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self';
    ```
- **X-Frame-Options & Clickjacking**  
  • `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- **X-Content-Type-Options**  
  • `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- **CSRF Protection**  
  • Implement anti-CSRF tokens for any form or state-changing request if applicable.
- **Secure Headers Middleware**  
  • Use a library like Helmet (for Node.js) or built-in middleware to set these headers.

---

## 7. Dependency & Configuration Management

- **Lockfiles**  
  • Commit `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` to ensure reproducible builds.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**  
  • Integrate SCA tools (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk) into CI to detect vulnerable dependencies.
- **Minimal Footprint**  
  • Review third-party packages; remove unused or large dependencies.
- **Secure Defaults**  
  • Disable debug or verbose logging in production.  
  • Ensure environment-specific configurations use secure settings by default.

---

## 8. Infrastructure & Deployment

- **Server Hardening**  
  • Disable unnecessary services and close unused network ports.  
  • Apply OS and framework security patches promptly.
- **TLS Configuration**  
  • Disable weak ciphers (e.g., RC4, DES) and older protocols (SSLv3, TLS 1.0/1.1).
- **Environment Segregation**  
  • Separate staging and production credentials.  
  • Enforce least privilege on cloud IAM roles and database users.

---

## 9. Monitoring, Alerting & Incident Response

- **Error Tracking**  
  • Integrate an error monitoring service (e.g., Sentry) to capture exceptions.
- **Alerts**  
  • Configure alerts for repeated webhook signature failures or rate limit hits.
- **Incident Playbook**  
  • Document steps for secret rotation, service lockdown, and notification.

---

## 10. Ongoing Security Practices

- **Periodic Reviews**  
  • Conduct regular security code reviews and penetration tests.
- **Threat Modeling**  
  • Revisit threat models when adding new features (e.g., new API endpoints).
- **Training & Documentation**  
  • Keep `.cursor/rules/` updated with security guidelines and onboarding notes.
