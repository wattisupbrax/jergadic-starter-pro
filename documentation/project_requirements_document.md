# jergadic-starter-pro Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

jergadic-starter-pro is a modern web-application boilerplate built with a file-based routing framework (e.g., Next.js 13+ or Remix) and TypeScript. It provides a pre-configured UI foundation—global styles, custom fonts, a root layout—and essential integrations (user authentication with Clerk, webhook handling) so that developers can skip the repetitive setup work and focus on building features.

This starter addresses the pain points of setting up a scalable, maintainable codebase from scratch. Key objectives for version 1 are:

• Enable spinning up a brand-new project in minutes with minimal configuration.  
• Enforce best practices (TypeScript, modular components, styling conventions).  
• Provide out-of-the-box authentication (Clerk) and a serverless webhook endpoint.  
• Offer built-in project guidelines via the `.cursor/rules` directory to keep code consistent.

**Success criteria:** a developer can clone the repo, install dependencies, configure a few environment variables, and have a working UI plus secure auth and webhook handling in under 10 minutes.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope (v1)

• File-based routing under `app/`:
  - `app/page.tsx` (home/landing page)  
  - `app/layout.tsx` (root layout + Clerk provider)  
  - `app/api/webhooks/route.ts` (serverless webhook endpoint)

• Global styling and typography:
  - `app/globals.css`  
  - Custom fonts (`app/fonts/GeistMonoVF.woff`, `GeistVF.woff`)

• Reusable component directory (`components/`):
  - Authentication provider (`components/providers/clerk-provider.tsx`)  
  - Placeholder for additional UI elements

• Authentication integration with Clerk:
  - Sign-up, sign-in, session management  
  - Protected routes via the Clerk React SDK

• Project guidelines and coding conventions in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`  
  (for AI assistants or developer reference)

### Out-of-Scope (v1)

• Additional pages or dashboard components beyond the home page  
• Complex state management (Redux, Recoil) – use React Context or local state for now  
• Payment, analytics, or third-party integrations beyond Clerk/webhooks  
• Multi-language (i18n) support  
• Comprehensive test suite (unit/E2E) — to be added later  
• CI/CD configuration and deployment pipelines

## 3. User Flow

A **developer** experience:
1. Clone the repo and run `npm install`.  
2. Create a `.env` file and add `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, and `WEBHOOK_SECRET`.  
3. Run `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:3000`.  
4. The landing page renders with global styles and custom fonts.  
5. Developer can navigate to `/api/webhooks` with a test HTTP POST (with the secret header) to see the webhook handler at work.

An **end-user** experience (when developers add protected pages):
1. End user visits the public home page and clicks “Sign In.”  
2. Clerk’s hosted UI appears—user signs up or logs in.  
3. Upon successful auth, Clerk redirects back and the protected layout loads, giving access to app pages.  
4. External services send events to `/api/webhooks/route.ts`, which validates the signature and triggers server-side logic (e.g., notifications).

## 4. Core Features

• **Authentication (Clerk)**: Sign-up, sign-in, session handling, protected routes
• **Global Styles & Fonts**: `globals.css`, `app/fonts/*.woff`
• **File-Based Routing**: Pages (`page.tsx`), layouts (`layout.tsx`), API routes under `app/api/`
• **Webhook Endpoint**: `/api/webhooks/route.ts` with payload validation
• **Layout Component**: Root wrapper that loads global CSS, fonts, and providers
• **Component Folder**: Reusable UI pieces and provider wrappers in `components/providers/`
• **Project Guidelines**: `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` for coding standards and AI prompts

---

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

• Frontend: Next.js 13+ (App Router) or Remix, React, TypeScript  
• Styling: CSS modules / global CSS (with the option to add Tailwind)  
• Fonts: Local `.woff` files in `app/fonts`  
• Backend: Next.js API routes (Node.js)  
• Auth: Clerk React SDK  
• Validation: Zod (suggested) for webhook payload/schema validation  
• Linting/Formatting: ESLint, Prettier  
• AI & Code Guidance: `.cursor` plugin with custom rules  
• IDE: VSCode with Cursor and Windsurf extensions  
• Deployment: Vercel (recommended) or any Node.js host

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

• **Performance**:  
  - Time to First Byte (TTFB) ≤ 200 ms  
  - Lighthouse performance score ≥ 90

• **Security**:  
  - Enforce HTTPS  
  - Store secrets in environment variables only  
  - Verify webhook signatures before processing  

• **Accessibility**:  
  - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance  
  - Proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

• **Scalability**:  
  - Support growth from a handful of routes to dozens  
  - Modular architecture to add pages/API endpoints easily

• **Usability**:  
  - Clear folder/file naming conventions  
  - Self-documenting code and in-repo guidelines

---

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

• Node.js ≥ v18 and npm ≥ v8 are required.  
• Clerk account and API keys must be set up before first run.  
• Webhook secret header must match the secret in `.env`.  
• Developers will install and enable the `.cursor` plugin in their IDE.  
• This starter assumes only one auth provider (Clerk) in v1.

---

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

• **Webhook Security**: Default handler doesn’t verify signatures—must implement signature check in `route.ts`.  
• **Font Load Performance**: Local `.woff` files can delay initial paint—consider font subsetting or a CDN.  
• **SSR vs. CSR Boundaries**: Mixing server components and client components can cause hydration issues—document best practices.  
• **Outdated `.cursor` Rules**: Guidelines may become stale—schedule periodic reviews.  
• **Env Variable Leaks**: Ensure client build only sees `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars; keep others secret.
