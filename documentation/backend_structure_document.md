# Backend Structure Document: jergadic-starter-pro

## 1. Backend Architecture

The backend for `jergadic-starter-pro` is built around a modern, server-centric approach provided by frameworks like Next.js (App Router) or Remix. Key points:

- **File-based routing**: Each folder under `app/api` automatically becomes an API route. No extra configuration is needed.
- **Serverless functions**: API route files (for example, `app/api/webhooks/route.ts`) are deployed as isolated serverless endpoints. This keeps each function lightweight and easy to scale.
- **Component colocation**: Related logic and UI live side by side in the `app` folder (pages, layouts, styles, APIs). This makes it easy to navigate and maintain.
- **Design patterns**:
  - **Single responsibility**: Each route or component does one thing (UI, auth, webhook handling).
  - **Dependency injection** via providers (e.g., Clerk) in the root layout.

How this supports the project:
- **Scalability**: Serverless endpoints scale automatically with demand. Adding more routes or functions does not require complex infrastructure changes.
- **Maintainability**: Clear folder structure and TypeScript type safety make it easy to onboard new developers and refactor code.
- **Performance**: Static assets (CSS, fonts) and UI components are served from a global CDN. Serverless functions spin up on demand, minimizing idle cost.

## 2. Database Management

As a starter kit, `jergadic-starter-pro` does not include a built-in database. Instead, it offloads user data management to Clerk and keeps the core backend stateless. If you need to store application data, you can integrate a database of your choice. Here are recommended options:

- SQL databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) with an ORM like Prisma:
  - Relational structure for well-defined schemas.
  - Transactions, joins, and strong consistency.
- NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB):
  - Flexible schema for rapidly evolving data models.
  - Built-in horizontal scaling for large datasets.
- Data management practices:
  - Use environment variables for database credentials.
  - Implement migrations (e.g., Prisma Migrate, Alembic).
  - Validate inputs server-side (Zod or Joi) before writing to the database.

## 3. Database Schema

Since there is no database included by default, here is an example schema for a simple webhook logging table in PostgreSQL:

SQL Schema (example):

```sql
CREATE TABLE webhooks (
  id              SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  event_type      TEXT NOT NULL,
  payload         JSONB NOT NULL,
  received_at     TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  processed       BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

- **id**: Unique identifier for each webhook event.  
- **event_type**: The type or name of the event received.  
- **payload**: The full JSON payload sent by the external service.  
- **received_at**: Timestamp when the webhook was received.  
- **processed**: Flag indicating if the payload was handled by the system.

If you choose a NoSQL store, you would typically store a document like this:

```
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  eventType: "user.signup",
  payload: { /* original JSON */ },
  receivedAt: ISODate("2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"),
  processed: false
}
```

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

The project follows a RESTful, serverless approach. Key endpoint:

- **POST /api/webhooks**
  - Purpose: Receive and process incoming webhook events.
  - Input: JSON payload from external services (e.g., payment gateways, third-party apps).
  - Process:
    1. Verify request origin (signature check).
    2. Validate payload structure (use Zod or similar).
    3. Optionally log to database or trigger internal workflows.
  - Response:
    - 200 OK on success.
    - 4xx/5xx on validation or processing errors.

Additional endpoints can be added by creating new files under `app/api`:
- `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` for custom login logic (if needed).
- `app/api/users/[id]/route.ts` for user-specific data access.

## 5. Hosting Solutions

By default, this starter is designed for **serverless deployment** on platforms like **Vercel** or **Netlify**:

- **Vercel** (ideal for Next.js):
  - Automatic deployments from Git pushes.  
  - Global CDN for static assets and edge caching.  
  - Zero-configuration serverless functions.  
- **Netlify**:
  - Similar zero-config build and deploy.  
  - Lambda functions for API routes.  

Alternative on cloud providers:
- **AWS Lambda + API Gateway** for functions, S3 for static files.  
- **Azure Functions** with Azure Static Web Apps.  

Benefits of serverless hosting:
- **Reliability**: Built-in redundancy and failover.  
- **Scalability**: Instant scaling to handle spikes.  
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Pay only for execution time and bandwidth.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

Even in a serverless setup, several components work together to deliver a fast, reliable experience:

- **Load Balancer / API Gateway**: Automatically routes incoming API requests to the correct function.  
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Distributes static assets (CSS, fonts, images) globally, reducing latency.  
- **Caching Layer**:
  - HTTP caching headers for static content.  
  - Optionally, Redis or in-memory store for dynamic data caching.  
- **Edge Functions**: (Vercel Edge) Run lightweight code closer to users for low-latency responses.

## 7. Security Measures

Several practices ensure that user data and application integrity remain protected:

- **Authentication & Authorization**:
  - Clerk handles user sign-up, login, session management, and multi-factor auth.  
  - Protected routes wrap pages/components in a Clerk provider.  
- **HTTPS everywhere**: All traffic is encrypted in transit.  
- **Webhook signature verification**: Check incoming webhook headers against a shared secret to confirm authenticity.  
- **Environment variables**: Store secrets (API keys, DB credentials, webhook secrets) outside the codebase.  
- **Input validation**: Use schema validators (Zod, Joi) to prevent injection and malformed data.  
- **CORS policies**: Restrict which origins can call your API endpoints.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

Keeping an eye on performance and reliability is key:

- **Logging & Error Tracking**:
  - Use platform logs (Vercel/Netlify) for function invocations.  
  - Integrate Sentry or LogRocket for real-time error monitoring.  
- **Alerts**: Configure alerts for failed deployments, error rate spikes, or increased latency.  
- **Performance Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics or third-party APMs (New Relic, Datadog).  
- **CI/CD**:
  - GitHub Actions or built-in platform pipelines to run linting, tests, and deployment.  
  - Automated testing (unit, integration, end-to-end) before each release.
- **Regular Maintenance**:
  - Keep dependencies up to date.  
  - Rotate secrets and environment variables periodically.  
  - Audit third-party integrations (Clerk, payment gateways).

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

The backend setup for `jergadic-starter-pro` is intentionally minimal and serverless, giving you a clean slate while providing essential tooling:

- **Architecture**: Modern file-based routing with serverless functions.  
- **Scalability**: Automatic with your hosting platform—no manual servers to manage.  
- **Extensibility**: Easily add databases, caching, or new API endpoints as needed.  
- **Security**: Outsourced auth (Clerk) and built-in verification for webhooks; environment variable management.
