## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
A brand new user arrives at the application’s landing page, which is served by the main home component. Here, a clear invitation to sign in or sign up is displayed. When the user clicks the sign-in button, Clerk’s authentication modal appears, offering both email and password entry as well as social login options if configured. During sign-up, the user enters their name, email, and desired password. If the user loses access to their password, they can click a “Forgot Password” link in the modal, receive a password reset email, and follow the secure link to set a new password. Once authentication completes, the user is wrapped in Clerk’s provider context and automatically redirected to the main dashboard page. A sign-out option is always available in the header, and clicking it calls Clerk’s signOut function and returns the user to the landing page.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
Upon successful authentication, the user is directed to the dashboard, which is defined by the root layout and home page components. The layout injects custom global styles and fonts, as well as a top navigation bar. The navigation bar displays links to Home, Webhooks, Profile, Settings, and, when applicable, Admin Rules. Below the navigation, the dashboard shows a welcome message and a summary of recent webhook events or status indicators for external integrations. The sidebar can be toggled to reveal or hide additional menu items. Every navigation link leads the user to a different module while keeping the same consistent page frame rendered by the layout component.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When the user clicks on the “Webhooks” link, the application navigates to the Webhooks page. This page fetches a list of events from the server-side API endpoint at `/api/webhooks/route.ts` and displays each event with its timestamp and type. The user can click on an event to expand its payload details in a formatted view. A button labeled “Test Webhook” triggers a POST request to the same endpoint, simulating an incoming event and refreshing the list. To return to the dashboard or navigate to other modules, the user uses the top navigation bar or the sidebar.

Selecting the “Profile” link brings the user to a page that reads data directly from Clerk’s user session. The user’s name, email, and avatar appear in readonly form until the user clicks an Edit action. In edit mode, form fields become active and the user can change their display name or upload a new avatar image. Saving those changes calls Clerk’s update functions, and a success notification appears once the profile update completes. The user navigates away using the Home link in the header.

If the user has been granted administrative rights, the top navigation bar includes an “Admin Rules” link. Clicking this opens a page that renders markdown files stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory. Each markdown document is loaded and shown with a live preview. An admin can click an Edit button to update the content inline. Upon saving, the changes are committed to the documentation store via an internal file API, and a confirmation message appears. To leave the admin section, the user simply clicks any of the standard navigation links.

## Settings and Account Management
In the Settings section, the user can configure application-wide preferences such as light or dark theme mode and notification toggles for webhook activity. If the application includes billing, a Billing area shows the current subscription plan, renewal date, and offers upgrade or cancel options. All billing UI is integrated either through Clerk’s billing components or a third-party payment provider. After making changes, the user saves their preferences and sees a brief confirmation banner. Navigation back to the rest of the application is handled through the persistent sidebar or header links.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If the user enters incorrect login credentials, Clerk’s modal displays an inline error message prompting retry. When following an expired or invalid password reset link, the user lands on an error page with the option to request a new reset email. API errors such as failed data fetches show a banner at the top of the page describing the issue and offering a Retry button. Unauthorized attempts to access a restricted page automatically redirect to a 403 error page with a link back to Home. Any unhandled exceptions in server or client code ripple out to a generic error screen that matches the application styling, while detailed logs are sent to a monitoring service for developer investigation.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
From the moment a user lands on the home page to the daily review of webhook events, the application offers a seamless and coherent journey. Clerk’s authentication flows ensure secure and flexible sign-in or sign-up, while the root layout injects consistent styling and navigation controls across all pages. Core modules such as Webhooks, Profile, Settings, and Admin Rules are accessible through clear navigation and maintain state through the Clerk provider. Robust error handling and recovery paths are in place to guide the user back to productive workflows. This structured flow makes it easy for anyone to understand how the application works from first visit through to advanced administrative features without ever losing context or direction.
